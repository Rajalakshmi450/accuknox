A restaurant keeps a log of (eater_id, foodmenu_id) for all the diners. The eater_id
is a unique number for every diner and foodmenu_id is unique for every food item
served on the menu. Write a program that reads this log file and returns the top 3
menu items consumed. If you find an eater_id with the same foodmenu_id more
than once then show an error.

Expected output:
1. Code that can handle the above problem statement
2. Testcases (with example log files) that checks the possible conditions and unit
test code to verify those.
3. Code has to be submitted in your github repository (share the repo link).
4. Showcase a code pattern/construct that is used (optional, good to have) as
part of README.md.


SOLUTION : 

1. create a dataframe with the log file that has both eater_id and foodmenu_id 
2. if there are any duplicates found in both the columns throw error 
3. Else group by foodmenu_id and get the counts of eater_id and print the top 3 records
